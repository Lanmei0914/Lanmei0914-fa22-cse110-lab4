1. What was the bug?
   The bug is the input for num1 and num2 are both string type. So when we are doing the addition to sum1 and sum2 the result will also be a string not num.

2. How would you fix it? Include a screenshot of your fix. Name it fix.png (or whatever image extension you would like to use)
   We need convert the input num1 and num2 from string to num. So we can do the num addition correctly.
